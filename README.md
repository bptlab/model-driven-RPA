## Installation

#### Our recommendation: Robocorp RPA Software Installation Guide

To build, test, and run your robot, we recommend using Visual Studio Code with the Robocorp Code extension. This integrated development environment (IDE) provides all the necessary tools for creating software robots using human-readable syntax. Make sure you have the following:

- Visual Studio Code installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- Robocorp Code extension and the Robot Framework Language Server extension. These can be installed from within Visual Studio Code itself.

1.  Download and install Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Choose the version compatible with your operating system.
2.  Launch Visual Studio Code and install the required extensions:
    - Robocorp Code extension: Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), and search for "Robocorp Code." Click on the extension and click "Install."
    - Robot Framework Language Server extension: Similarly, search for "Robot Framework Language Server" in the Extensions view and install the extension.
3.  With the extensions installed, you're ready to start running the robot using Visual Studio Code with the Robocorp Code extension!
